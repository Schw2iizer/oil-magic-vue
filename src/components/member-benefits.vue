                  <ul style="text-align: left;">
                      <li>1. The best benefit of becoming a member is you all get wholesale pricing, which is 25% off retail price.</li>
                      <li>2. dōTERRA has an awesome program called, Loyalty Reward Program also known as LRP, that is optional for their members to participate in. This program can allow you to earn 10-30% back which every purchase. (More on the LRP later)</li>
                      <li>3. All my members gain access to my VIP facebook group. Here you will find live education and monthly themed classes. You will be able to ask questions and learn exactly how to use your essential oils.</li>
                      <li>4. Another member perk is the free product of the month. dōTERRA offers a product of the month every month which you can get for free! Any LRP order placed before the 15th of the month for 125pv will qualify you for this. It’s a different oil each month and dōTERRA let’s you know which oil it is on the first of the month.</li>
                      <li>5. Most months dōTERRA has an exclusive deal that changes month to month.</li>
